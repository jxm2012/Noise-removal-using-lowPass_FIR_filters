# Noise-removal-using-lowPass_FIR_filters


Python program done as an assignment for a Signal Processing class taught by Dr. Brezeale in CSE-3313 at UT Arlington

Given a noisy music file (.wav), this program makes use of a Low pass filter to remove noise and produce a clean version of the sample song. 

It also produces a frequency response plot showing the original signal and the windowed signal. A Hamming window is applied on it.
